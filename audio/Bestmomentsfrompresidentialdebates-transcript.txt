          one indisputable truth debates well they can make history  
          I've been there on September twenty six nineteen sixty the first televised presidential debate signaling a new era where appearances matter more than ever and gaffes however small are magnified all hardest thing for all Americans John if Kennedy a young senator from Massachusetts facing off against vice president Richard Nixon was known to be a fierce debater  
          but on screen Kennedy looks cool and calm while Nixon looks uncomfortable sweating profusely under the hot studio lights like a better shape right Nixon Flanders under the glare of television for all four debates Kennedy goes on to win the election  
          in nineteen seventy six president Gerald Ford makes this blunder in his debate with Georgia governor Jimmy Carter there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be underreported fenestration  
          I'm sorry what could I just follow the remark becomes a central theme in Carter's campaign is blamed by many for costing forward the election emphasis in nineteen eighty Ronald Reagan has repeatedly attacked by president Carter for his stance on health care governor Reagan as a modified began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare but Reagan wins fans and the election by staying cool and you go again four years later president Reagan again uses humor to handle attacks on his age during his debate with Walter Mondale and I want you to know that also  
          I will not make age an issue of this campaign I am not going to exploit  
          for political purposes  
          my opponent's youth and inexperience  
          in the next election democratic candidate Michael Dukakis is ask this controversial question his debate with vice president George Bush governor if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered  
          would you favor  
          an irrevocable death penalty for the killer  
          no I don't Bernard and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life the public sees his answer is cold and dispassionate and that very night his poll numbers drop  
          during the nineteen eighty eight vice presidential debate Republican senator Dan Quayle's comparison to John F. Kennedy elicit this blistering response from his opponent senator you're no Jack Kennedy  
          body language plays a part in the presidential debate in nineteen ninety two George HW bush to liberally looks at his watch and he pays for it when the audience and voters seed is disrespectful here is different somehow body language makes a difference in the debate between Al Gore and George W. bush as well gore size over and over again and bush the underdog surprises by winning the debate of course the election stuff government both president Obama and governor Romney or season debaters and experts say neither are prone to making major gaffes but if there is one thing that history has taught us again when it comes to presidential debates  
          spec the unexpected
