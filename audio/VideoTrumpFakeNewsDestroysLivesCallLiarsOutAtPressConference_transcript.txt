          you have been hearing more and more about the thing called Sheik news in the talking about people to go and say all sorts of things  

          but I will tell you some of the media outlets that idea with the fake news more so than anybody I could name them but I won't bother but you have few sitting right in front of us  

          %HESITATION so they're very very dishonest people  

          but I I think which is something we're going to have to live with I guess the advantage I have is that  

          I can speak back  

          when it happens to somebody that doesn't have this doesn't have that kind of a megaphone  

          they can't speak back it's a very sad thing I've seen people destroyed I've seen people absolutely destroyed and I think it's very unfair so all I can ask for is honest  

          reporters yes
