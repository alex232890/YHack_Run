          I'm gonna get back to this news which brought it about an hour ago not Michael Flynn has now turned himself in to the FBI do we have the judge with us which we do not yes you do who do not judge Hippolyta what that the significance here seems to be that may be the up to him pleading guilty opens the door and a pass way directly to president trump is that the case  

          I think it probably is the case during let me give you some sense you're a numbers person some numbers  

          if general Flynn had been group charged and convicted  

          of all of the crimes for which the government says it has evidence against him he would have been facing sixty years six zero years in jail  

          as a result of the guilty plea this morning that's been reduced to somewhere between six and twelve months  

          now that enormous reduction does not come easily it comes when you give this government something that they desperately want  

          so the tantalizing question is what is that the general plan has that the government wants  

          knowledge of the behavior and communications and interactions of people in the trump campaign with the Russian government in the time period June twenty fifteen until the president's election  

          now we saw some of this coming one last week the day before thanksgiving  

          the generals lawyers told the White House that they would no longer participate in what's known as the joint defense agreement that was an agreement amongst the lawyers for the president and general flat  

          which they agree they will share evidence share communications and not point fingers at each other  

          once general Flynn's lawyers withdrew from the agreement  

          they went to the special prosecutor and must have cut a deal on Monday which is when they visited him  

          so sometime between Monday and today they reduce that deal to writing the prosecutors lawyers a satisfied the general has real evidence that we can really used to prosecute someone perhaps the president we don't know  

          and in order to lock the general in they got him to plead guilty of this morning know once he pleads guilty we will see a written plea agreement  

          document at somewhere between five and ten pages in length which will tell us what the general has agreed to do and what the government has agreed not to do to him in return for what he's going to tell the judge that thank you very much and if the breaking in for this one because this is very important stuff and it's up to where we appreciate it
