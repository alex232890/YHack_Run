In a Saturday appearance on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) continued her crusade against President Donald Trump in the wake of former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s guilty plea, saying it will be found the president “needs to be impeached.”

“I think it’s going to be hard for the Republicans to continue to be silent and standing with this president as it unfolds,” Waters said to host Joy Reid. “This is the tip of the iceberg. There’s lots more to come. And I think it’s going to lead right to not only collusion, obstruction of justice, money laundering. It goes on and on and on.”

Waters added, “We are at a point in time in the United States of America with a president who is involved in all kinds of things that would shock people, I do believe. So, I know that I’ve been calling for impeachment. I know I’ve been criticized, but I know everything that I have learned about him and his allies, their interest in lifting the sanctions, their connection to Putin, their connection to the Kremlin — I know that we are going to find that this president needs to be impeached.”
