“Congratulations to ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt,” Trump wrote.

ABC executives suspended Ross for four weeks without pay, after first trying to “clarify” a false report that Flynn was expected to testify that as a candidate, Trump directed his former National Security Adviser to contact the Russians on his behalf.

“More Networks and ‘papers’ should do the same with their Fake News!” Trump said, welcoming the decision.



Trump also mused about the differences between the FBI investigations of Mike Flynn and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

“So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday ‘interrogation’ with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times…and nothing happens to her?” Trump noted on Twitter on Saturday night. “Rigged system, or just a double standard?”

Trump again signaled frustration with his Attorney General Jeff Sessions, floating the suggestion that Clinton be prosecuted.

“Many people in our Country are asking what the ‘Justice’ Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails?” he continued. “No justice!”

The president traveled to New York City on Saturday for fundraisers, but it was clear that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s Russian investigation and Flynn’s decision to cooperate weighed on his mind.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI,” he told his followers on Twitter on Saturday morning. “He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”
