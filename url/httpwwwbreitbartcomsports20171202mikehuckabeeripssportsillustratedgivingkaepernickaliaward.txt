A day after SI made the announcement that Kaepernick would receive the Ali award, Huckabee ripped the magazine for the decision on Twitter:

Sports Illustrated Executive Editor Steve Cannella explained their decision to give Kaepernick the award in an interview with USA Today Sports.

“The Muhammad Ali Legacy Award is given to those who make the world a better place. The fact Colin hasn’t played this year or been on the field doesn’t disqualify him. That fact that he hasn’t played in a game actually shows what he has sacrificed for standing up for what he believes. There will never be another Muhammad Ali, but you can see the echoes of (Ali) in what Colin has done over the last 12 to 15 months.”

Sports Illustrated will present the award to Kaepernick on Tuesday, at SI’s Sportsperson of the Year Awards show in New York.
