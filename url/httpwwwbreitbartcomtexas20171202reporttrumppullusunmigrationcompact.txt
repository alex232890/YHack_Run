“Today, the US Mission to the United Nations informed the UN Secretary-General that the United States is ending its participation in the Global Compact on Migration,” U.S. officials said in a report from AFP.

Officials stated that the New York Declaration, a non-binding political declaration unanimously approved in a non-binding resolution in September 2016, “contains numerous provisions that are inconsistent with U.S. immigration and refugee policies and the Trump Administration’s immigration principles.”

The American pullout from the pact is scheduled for the end of 2018, AFP reported.

Ambassador Nikki Haley said the U.S. will continue in its “generosity” by supporting migrants and refugees around the world.

The withdrawal is consistent with the president’s America First policies.

“We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country,” Haley stated. “The global approach in the New York Declaration is simply not compatible with US sovereignty.”

This is the second U.N. accord from which the new administration has withdrawn.

In August, President Trump notified the U.N. that the U.S. intends to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, Breitbart News’ Adam Shaw reported.

“As the President indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers,” State Department officials said in a written statement.
